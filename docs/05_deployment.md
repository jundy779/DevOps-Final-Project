# Phase 5: Deployment & Monitoring

## Deployment Checklist

### Pre-deployment
- [ ] Run all tests
- [ ] Check security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Verify environment variables
- [ ] Backup current database
- [ ] Check resource requirements

### Deployment Steps
1. Deploy to staging environment
2. Run smoke tests
3. Deploy to production
4. Verify all services are running
5. Check monitoring dashboards

## Backup Strategy

### Database Backup
- Daily automated backups
- Retention period: 30 days
- Backup location: Secure cloud storage
- Backup verification: Weekly restore tests

### Application Backup
- Configuration backups
- Kubernetes manifests
- Environment variables
- SSL certificates

## Disaster Recovery Plan

### Recovery Time Objectives (RTO)
- Critical systems: 1 hour
- Non-critical systems: 4 hours

### Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)
- Database: 5 minutes
- Application state: 15 minutes

### Recovery Procedures
1. Database Recovery
   ```bash
   # Restore from backup
   kubectl exec -it postgres-0 -- pg_restore -d voting_db /backups/latest.dump
   ```

2. Application Recovery
   ```bash
   # Redeploy application
   kubectl apply -f kubernetes/
   ```

3. Monitoring Recovery
   ```bash
   # Restore monitoring
   kubectl apply -f monitoring/
   ```

## Security Monitoring

### Security Checks
- Regular vulnerability scanning
- Dependency updates
- Access log monitoring
- Failed login attempts
- Unusual traffic patterns

### Alert Thresholds
- Failed login attempts: >5 per minute
- CPU usage: >80% for 5 minutes
- Memory usage: >85% for 5 minutes
- Disk usage: >90%
- Error rate: >1% of requests

## Production Environment

### Resource Requirements
- CPU: 4 cores minimum
- Memory: 8GB minimum
- Storage: 50GB minimum
- Network: 100Mbps minimum

### Scaling Rules
- CPU: Scale up at 70% usage
- Memory: Scale up at 80% usage
- Requests: Scale up at 1000 RPS

## Monitoring Setup

### Metrics to Monitor
- Application metrics
  - Request rate
  - Response time
  - Error rate
  - Active users
- System metrics
  - CPU usage
  - Memory usage
  - Disk usage
  - Network traffic
- Business metrics
  - Total votes
  - Active elections
  - User registrations

### Alerting Rules
- Critical alerts: Immediate notification
- Warning alerts: Daily summary
- Info alerts: Weekly report

## Maintenance Procedures

### Regular Maintenance
- Weekly security updates
- Monthly dependency updates
- Quarterly performance review
- Annual security audit

### Emergency Procedures
1. Identify issue
2. Assess impact
3. Implement fix
4. Verify resolution
5. Document incident
